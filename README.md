# 🚀 My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java programming repository! This is where I document my progress as I learn Java from the ground up. Each program represents a step forward in my understanding of Java concepts and programming fundamentals.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains my Java learning projects, organized by concepts and difficulty. I'm committed to:
- Writing clean, well-commented code
- Following Java best practices
- Documenting my learning process
- Committing regularly to track my progress

## 🎯 Current Progress

### ✅ Completed Programs

1. **HelloWorld.java** - The classic first program
   - Concepts: Basic syntax, System.out.println()
   
2. **Message.java** - User input and string handling
   - Concepts: Scanner class, user input, string operations, resource management
   
3. **OddEven.java** - Determine if a number is odd or even
   - Concepts: Modulo operator, ternary operator, conditional logic
   
4. **IsPrime.java** - Check if a number is prime
   - Concepts: For loops, conditional statements, mathematical logic
   
5. **Palindrome.java** - Check if a number reads the same forwards and backwards
   - Concepts: While loops, mathematical operations, variable manipulation
   
6. **ReverseNumber.java** - Reverse the digits of a number
   - Concepts: While loops, modulo and division operations

### 🔄 Currently Learning

- Loop structures and their applications
- Mathematical problem solving with code
- Algorithm thinking and logic building

### 📋 Next Up

- Array operations and manipulation
- String processing and methods
- User input handling with Scanner class
- Method creation and parameter passing

## 🛠️ How to Run

Each Java file can be compiled and run independently:

```bash
# Compile
javac ProgramName.java

# Run
java ProgramName
```

**Note:** Currently, all programs use hardcoded values. Future programs will include user input functionality.
